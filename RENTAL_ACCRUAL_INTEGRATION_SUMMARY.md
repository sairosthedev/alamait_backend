## 💰 Financial Impact

### Automatic Accounting Entries Created:
For each new student registration, the system now creates:

```
Example: Macdonald Sairos - Exclusive Room ($220/month, 5 months)
├── Prorated Rent: $92.26 (13 days of first month)
├── Admin Fee: $20 (St Kilda residence)
└── Security Deposit: $220
Total Accounting Entry: $332.26

Double-Entry Bookkeeping:
DEBIT:  Accounts Receivable - Tenants (1100)     $332.26
CREDIT: Student Accommodation Rent (4001)        $92.26
CREDIT: Administrative Fees (4002)               $20.00
CREDIT: Tenant Security Deposits (2020)          $220.00
```
