# Expense Date Approval Fix

## Issue
When finance approves a request, the expense is being created with the current date (`new Date()`) instead of using the finance approval date (`dateApproved`). This causes the expense date to be incorrect in financial reports.

## Root Cause
The `createItemizedExpensesForRequest` and `createSimpleExpenseForRequest` functions were trying to use the `approvalDate` variable, but it was not in their scope. The `approvalDate` was defined in the `financeApproval` function but not passed as a parameter to these helper functions.

## Solution
Updated the function signatures to accept `approvalDate` as a parameter and pass it from the calling function.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Function Signatures

**Before:**
```javascript
async function createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user) {
    // ...
    expenseDate: approvalDate, // ❌ approvalDate not defined in scope
}

async function createItemizedExpensesForRequest(request, user) {
    // ...
    expenseDate: approvalDate, // ❌ approvalDate not defined in scope
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async function createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user, approvalDate) {
    // ...
    expenseDate: approvalDate, // ✅ approvalDate passed as parameter
}

async function createItemizedExpensesForRequest(request, user, approvalDate) {
    // ...
    expenseDate: approvalDate, // ✅ approvalDate passed as parameter
}
```

### 2. Updated Function Calls

**Before:**
```javascript
// In financeApproval function
if (request.items && request.items.length > 0) {
    await createItemizedExpensesForRequest(request, user);
} else {
    await createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user);
}

// Later in the same function
await createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// In financeApproval function
if (request.items && request.items.length > 0) {
    await createItemizedExpensesForRequest(request, user, approvalDate);
} else {
    await createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user, approvalDate);
}

// Later in the same function
await createSimpleExpenseForRequest(request, user, approvalDate);
```

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- **Finance Approval Date**: `2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z`
- **Expense Date**: `2025-09-09T17:04:36.126Z` (current date when expense was created)
- **Result**: Expense appears in September instead of August

### After Fix:
- **Finance Approval Date**: `2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z`
- **Expense Date**: `2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z` (matches finance approval date)
- **Result**: Expense correctly appears in August

## Code Flow

1. **Finance Approval**: User provides `dateApproved: "2025-08-12"`
2. **Approval Date Calculation**: `const approvalDate = dateApproved ? new Date(dateApproved) : new Date();`
3. **Expense Creation**: Functions now receive `approvalDate` as parameter
4. **Expense Date Setting**: `expenseDate: approvalDate` uses the correct date
5. **Financial Reports**: Expense appears in the correct month (August)

## Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Financial Reporting**
- Expenses now appear in the correct month based on when they were approved
- Income statements show expenses in the right period
- Cash flow statements reflect accurate timing

### 2. **Consistent Date Handling**
- All expense creation functions now use the same date logic
- Finance approval date is consistently used across all expense types
- No more discrepancies between approval date and expense date

### 3. **Better Audit Trail**
- Expense dates match the actual business decision date
- Easier to trace when expenses were approved vs when they were recorded
- More accurate historical reporting

## Example

### Request Data:
```json
{
    "approval": {
        "finance": {
            "approvedAt": "2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
    },
    "dateRequested": "2025-08-09T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Expense Created:
```json
{
    "expenseDate": "2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z", // ✅ Now matches finance approval date
    "approvedAt": "2025-08-12T00:00:00.000Z",
    "description": "plumbing"
}
```

## Deployment Required
**IMPORTANT**: This fix requires deployment to Render for the production server to use correct expense dates.

## Expected Result
After deployment, expenses created from finance-approved requests will use the finance approval date as the expense date, ensuring accurate financial reporting! 🎉

The expense date now correctly reflects when the finance approval occurred! 💰
