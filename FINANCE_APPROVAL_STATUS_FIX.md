# Finance Approval Status Fix for Requests Without Quotations

## Issue Description

The user reported that **requests without quotations were refusing to change their status to "pending-ceo-approval"** when finance approved them. This was causing requests to get stuck in the approval workflow.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, I found that the issue was in the `financeApproval` function in `src/controllers/requestController.js`. The function was only updating the `financeStatus` field but **not updating the main `status` field** to `'pending-ceo-approval'`.

### Problem Code (Before Fix)

```javascript
// Update finance status ONLY (do not change overall request status)
if (isApproved) {
    request.financeStatus = 'approved';
    console.log('✅ Setting financeStatus to approved');
} else if (isRejected) {
    request.financeStatus = 'rejected';
    console.log('❌ Setting financeStatus to rejected');
} else if (isWaitlisted) {
    request.financeStatus = 'waitlisted';
    console.log('⏳ Setting financeStatus to waitlisted');
}
```

**The Problem**: The function only updated `financeStatus` but never set the main `status` field to `'pending-ceo-approval'`, causing requests to remain in their current status.

### Comparison with Working Code

The maintenance controller (`src/controllers/finance/maintenanceController.js`) was working correctly because it explicitly set both fields:

```javascript
const updatedMaintenance = await Maintenance.findByIdAndUpdate(
    id,
    {
        $set: {
            financeStatus: 'approved',
            status: 'pending-ceo-approval', // ✅ This was missing in request controller
            // ... other fields
        }
    }
);
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code (After Fix)

```javascript
// Update finance status AND overall request status
if (isApproved) {
    request.financeStatus = 'approved';
    request.status = 'pending-ceo-approval'; // ✅ ADDED: Set status to pending CEO approval
    console.log('✅ Setting financeStatus to approved');
    console.log('✅ Setting status to pending-ceo-approval');
} else if (isRejected) {
    request.financeStatus = 'rejected';
    request.status = 'rejected'; // ✅ ADDED: Set status to rejected
    console.log('❌ Setting financeStatus to rejected');
    console.log('❌ Setting status to rejected');
} else if (isWaitlisted) {
    request.financeStatus = 'waitlisted';
    request.status = 'waitlisted'; // ✅ ADDED: Set status to waitlisted
    console.log('⏳ Setting financeStatus to waitlisted');
    console.log('⏳ Setting status to waitlisted');
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/controllers/requestController.js`** - Fixed the `financeApproval` function to properly set the status field

## Testing

A test script was created (`test-finance-approval-status-fix.js`) to verify the fix works correctly for:

1. **Requests without quotations** - Should change status to `'pending-ceo-approval'`
2. **Requests with quotations but none selected** - Should also change status to `'pending-ceo-approval'`

### Running the Test

```bash
cd alamait_backend
node test-finance-approval-status-fix.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Requests Without Quotations

1. **Finance approves request** → Status changes to `'pending-ceo-approval'`
2. **Finance rejects request** → Status changes to `'rejected'`
3. **Finance waitlists request** → Status changes to `'waitlisted'`

### For Requests With Quotations

1. **Finance approves with selected quotations** → Status changes to `'pending-ceo-approval'` (via `handleApproveWithSelectedQuotation`)
2. **Finance approves without selecting quotations** → Status changes to `'pending-ceo-approval'` (via `financeApproval`)

## Approval Workflow

The complete approval workflow now works correctly:

```
pending → finance approves → pending-ceo-approval → CEO approves → approved
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check the logs** - You should see both status update messages:
   ```
   ✅ Setting financeStatus to approved
   ✅ Setting status to pending-ceo-approval
   ```

2. **Check the database** - The request should have:
   ```javascript
   {
     status: 'pending-ceo-approval',
     financeStatus: 'approved',
     'approval.finance.approved': true
   }
   ```

3. **Check the frontend** - Requests should appear in the CEO's pending approval list

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- ✅ All finance approvals properly progress to CEO approval
- ✅ No requests get stuck in the approval workflow
- ✅ Consistent behavior between maintenance and request models
- ✅ Proper audit trail with status changes

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves potential issues with:
- Requests appearing in wrong status filters
- CEO not seeing approved requests
- Inconsistent approval workflow
- Audit trail gaps
