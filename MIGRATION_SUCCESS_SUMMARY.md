## 📋 **Next Steps for You**

### **1. Frontend Updates Required**
Your frontend needs to be updated to use the new simplified API endpoints. See `FRONTEND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for details:

**Key Changes:**
- **Petty Cash Allocation**: Only user selection + amount
- **Payment Processing**: Simplified forms
- **Transaction Display**: Automatic account determination
- **Financial Reports**: New reporting endpoints

### **2. API Endpoints Available**
The following new endpoints are ready to use:

```
POST /api/finance/allocate-petty-cash
POST /api/finance/record-petty-cash-expense
POST /api/finance/replenish-petty-cash
GET /api/finance/petty-cash-balances
GET /api/finance/petty-cash-user-balance/:userId

POST /api/finance/approve-maintenance-request

POST /api/finance/process-student-rent-payment

GET /api/financial-reports/income-statement
GET /api/financial-reports/balance-sheet
GET /api/financial-reports/cash-flow-statement
```

### **3. Data Cleanup (Optional)**
Some existing data has undefined fields that can be cleaned up:
- **3 transactions** with undefined transaction IDs
- **3 payments** with undefined payment methods

These don't affect functionality but can be cleaned for better reporting.
