### ‚ö†Ô∏è **3. ORPHANED TRANSACTIONS (IDENTIFIED)**

#### **Transaction TXN1754484578063REEQX**
- **Description**: AR Balance Correction
- **Date**: 6/8/2025
- **Source**: manual
- **Issue**: Missing source document link

#### **Transaction undefined**
- **Description**: Maintenance expense for water
- **Date**: 15/8/2025
- **Source**: N/A
- **Issue**: Completely orphaned transaction

## üõ†Ô∏è **Root Causes Identified**

### **1. Incorrect Transaction Posting**
The main issue is that **expense payments are being posted as CREDITS to asset accounts** instead of DEBITS to expense accounts.

**Correct Double-Entry Should Be:**
```
DEBIT: Expense Account (e.g., Water Expense) - $300.00
CREDIT: Asset Account (e.g., Bank Account) - $300.00
```

**What's Currently Happening:**
```
DEBIT: Asset Account (e.g., Bank Account) - $300.00  
CREDIT: Asset Account (e.g., Bank Account) - $300.00 ‚ùå
```

### **2. Missing Expense Account Postings**
Expense transactions are missing the DEBIT side to expense accounts, causing:
- Asset accounts to show negative balances
- Expenses to not appear in income statement
- Balance sheet equation to be unbalanced

### **3. Data Migration Issues**
The undefined account codes (9999, 1101) suggest data migration problems where:
- Some accounts were not properly mapped
- Transaction references were lost
- Account types were incorrectly assigned

## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Fixes**
1. **Created missing account 9999** - Suspense Account
2. **Created missing account 1101** - Accounts Receivable - General

### üìã **Manual Fixes Required**

#### **Fix 1: Correct Expense Transaction Postings**
For each suspicious transaction, ensure proper double-entry:

**Example - Water Expense:**
```javascript
// INCORRECT (Current)
{
  entries: [
    { accountCode: '1000', debit: 300, credit: 0 },    // Bank Account
    { accountCode: '1000', debit: 0, credit: 300 }     // Bank Account ‚ùå
  ]
}

// CORRECT (Should Be)
{
  entries: [
    { accountCode: '5001', debit: 300, credit: 0 },    // Water Expense
    { accountCode: '1000', debit: 0, credit: 300 }     // Bank Account
  ]
}
```

#### **Fix 2: Link Orphaned Transactions**
- **TXN1754484578063REEQX**: Link to proper AR correction document
- **undefined transaction**: Either link to source document or clean up

#### **Fix 3: Review All Expense Transactions**
Check all transactions with source `expense_payment` to ensure they have:
- DEBIT to appropriate expense account
- CREDIT to appropriate asset/liability account

## üìà **Expected Results After Fixes**

### **Before Fixes:**
```
Assets: -$885 ‚ùå
Liabilities: $13,035
Equity: -$18,508.97
Total: -$6,358.97 ‚ùå
```

### **After Fixes:**
```
Assets: +$X,XXX ‚úÖ
Liabilities: +$X,XXX
Equity: +$X,XXX
Total: Assets = Liabilities + Equity ‚úÖ
```
