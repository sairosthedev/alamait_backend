# Application Code Mapping System

## Overview

The Application Code Mapping System ensures that when students register with an application code, they are automatically linked to their corresponding applications, and debtors are created when applications are approved.

## üîÑ **Complete Flow**

### **1. Application Creation (Admin/Public)**
```
Admin creates application ‚Üí Application gets unique applicationCode
```

### **2. Student Registration**
```
Student registers with applicationCode ‚Üí System automatically links to application
```

### **3. Application Approval**
```
Admin approves application ‚Üí System automatically creates debtor
```

### **4. Debtor Creation**
```
Debtor created with complete application data ‚Üí Linked back to application
```

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **A. User Registration with Application Code**

When a student registers with an `applicationCode`:

```javascript
// In src/controllers/auth/authController.js
const { email, password, firstName, lastName, phone, applicationCode } = req.body;

// Create new user with application code
user = new User({
    email,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    phone,
    password,
    applicationCode,  // ‚Üê Application code from registration
    role: 'student',
    isVerified: true
});
```

### **B. Auto-Linking Middleware (User Model)**

The User model automatically links to existing applications:

```javascript
// In src/models/User.js - post-save middleware
userSchema.post('save', async function(doc) {
    if (this.isNew) {
        // Find applications with matching email OR application code
        const applicationsToLink = await Application.find({
            $and: [
                {
                    $or: [
                        { email: this.email },           // ‚Üê Match by email
                        { applicationCode: this.applicationCode }  // ‚Üê Match by application code
                    ]
                },
                {
                    $or: [
                        { student: { $exists: false } },
                        { student: null },
                        { student: undefined }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        });
        
        // Link applications to user
        for (const application of applicationsToLink) {
            application.student = this._id;
            await application.save();
            
            // If approved, create debtor immediately
            if (application.status === 'approved') {
                // Create debtor with application data
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### **C. Application Approval Process**

When an admin approves an application:

```javascript
// In src/controllers/admin/applicationController.js
case 'approve':
    application.status = 'approved';
    
    // Create debtor account for the student
    const debtor = await createDebtorForStudent(studentUser, {
        createdBy: req.user._id,
        residenceId: residence._id,
        roomNumber: roomNumber,
        roomPrice: room.price || 0,
        startDate: application.startDate,
        endDate: application.endDate,
        application: application._id,           // ‚Üê Link to application
        applicationCode: application.applicationCode  // ‚Üê Link application code
    });
```

### **D. Debtor Creation with Application Data**

The debtor service creates debtors with complete application information:

```javascript
// In src/services/debtorService.js
const debtorData = {
    debtorCode,
    user: user._id,
    accountCode,
    // ... other fields ...
    
    // Application linking
    application: options.application,           // ‚Üê Application ID
    applicationCode: options.applicationCode,  // ‚Üê Application code
    
    // Financial data from application
    startDate: options.startDate,
    endDate: options.endDate,
    roomPrice: options.roomPrice,
    residence: options.residenceId,
    roomNumber: options.roomNumber
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Scripts Available**

### **1. Map All Application Codes**
```bash
npm run map-application-codes
```
- Maps ALL users with application codes to their applications
- Creates debtors for approved applications
- Updates existing debtors with application links

### **2. Fix Specific User (Macdonald)**
```bash
npm run fix-macdonald-mapping
```
- Specifically fixes Macdonald Sairos' application mapping
- Creates debtor if application is approved
- Links everything properly

### **3. Debug Application-Debtor Relationship**
```bash
npm run debug-application-debtor <applicationId>
```
- Debug why a specific application doesn't have a debtor
- Shows all the linking information

## üîç **Verification Points**

### **Check Application Has Student Field**
```javascript
// Application should have:
{
    _id: "application_id",
    student: "user_id",           // ‚Üê Should be set
    applicationCode: "APP123...",
    status: "approved"
}
```

### **Check Debtor Has Application Link**
```javascript
// Debtor should have:
{
    _id: "debtor_id",
    user: "user_id",
    application: "application_id",     // ‚Üê Should be set
    applicationCode: "APP123...",      // ‚Üê Should be set
    debtorCode: "DR0001"
}
```

### **Check User Has Application Code**
```javascript
// User should have:
{
    _id: "user_id",
    email: "student@email.com",
    applicationCode: "APP123...",      // ‚Üê Should be set
    role: "student"
}
```

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Application Missing Student Field**
**Cause**: User registration didn't trigger auto-linking
**Solution**: Run `npm run map-application-codes`

### **Issue 2: Debtor Missing Application Link**
**Cause**: Debtor created before application approval
**Solution**: Run `npm run map-application-codes` to update existing debtors

### **Issue 3: No Debtor Created**
**Cause**: Application not approved or missing room/residence data
**Solution**: Check application status and room allocation

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of This System**

1. **Automatic Linking**: No manual intervention needed
2. **Complete Data**: Debtors have all application information
3. **Audit Trail**: Full traceability from application to debtor
4. **Error Prevention**: Prevents orphaned applications or debtors
5. **Real-time Creation**: Debtors created immediately when applications approved

## üîß **Maintenance**

- Run `npm run map-application-codes` periodically to catch any missed mappings
- Use debug scripts to troubleshoot specific issues
- Monitor logs for auto-linking success/failures
