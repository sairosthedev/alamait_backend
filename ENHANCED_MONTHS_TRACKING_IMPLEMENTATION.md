# Enhanced Months Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced months tracking functionality implemented in the `DebtorTransactionSyncService` that includes lease start month in the months accrued calculation and provides detailed tracking of months accrued and months paid with their respective amounts.

## Key Features

### 1. Lease Start Month Inclusion
- **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects lease start dates from the `Application` model
- **Complete Month Range**: Includes all months from lease start to current month in the months accrued calculation
- **Prorated Month Handling**: Identifies and flags prorated months when lease starts mid-month
- **Expected vs Actual**: Compares expected months from lease period with actual accrued months

### 2. Detailed Months Tracking
- **Months Accrued**: Tracks all months for which rent has been accrued, including lease start month
- **Months Paid**: Tracks all months for which payments have been received
- **Transaction Details**: Maintains detailed transaction history for each month
- **Summary Statistics**: Provides comprehensive summary statistics for both accrued and paid months

### 3. Real-time Synchronization
- **Automatic Updates**: Debtor records are automatically updated when accruals are created or payments are made
- **Transaction-Based Totals**: All totals are calculated directly from `TransactionEntry` documents
- **Consistent State**: Ensures debtor data remains consistent with transaction data

## Implementation Details

### Core Service: `DebtorTransactionSyncService`

#### Key Methods

1. **`updateMonthsAccruedAndPaidSummary(debtor, studentId)`**
   - Calculates and updates months accrued and paid summary
   - Includes lease start month and all months from lease start to current month
   - Generates comprehensive summary statistics

2. **`updateDebtorFromAccrual(transactionEntry, studentId, amount, monthKey, metadata)`**
   - Updates debtor when monthly rent accruals are created
   - Automatically syncs expected amounts and months accrued

3. **`updateDebtorFromPayment(transactionEntry, studentId, amount, monthKey, metadata)`**
   - Updates debtor when payments are allocated
   - Automatically syncs paid amounts and months paid

4. **`recalculateDebtorTotalsFromTransactions(debtor, studentId)`**
   - Calculates `totalOwed`, `totalPaid`, and `currentBalance` from transactions
   - Ensures totals are always consistent with transaction data

### Lease Start Month Logic

```javascript
// Get lease start date from Application model
const application = await Application.findOne({ 
    student: studentId,
    status: { $in: ['approved', 'waitlisted'] }
}).sort({ applicationDate: -1 });

if (leaseStartDate) {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const startMonth = new Date(leaseStartDate.getFullYear(), leaseStartDate.getMonth(), 1);
    const endMonth = new Date(currentDate.getFullYear(), currentDate.getMonth(), 1);
    
    // Generate all months from lease start to current month
    let currentMonth = new Date(startMonth);
    while (currentMonth <= endMonth) {
        const monthKey = `${currentMonth.getFullYear()}-${String(currentMonth.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')}`;
        
        monthsAccrued[monthKey] = {
            month: monthKey,
            amount: 0,
            transactionCount: 0,
            transactions: [],
            isLeaseStartMonth: currentMonth.getTime() === startMonth.getTime(),
            isProrated: currentMonth.getTime() === startMonth.getTime() && leaseStartDate.getDate() > 1
        };
        
        currentMonth.setMonth(currentMonth.getMonth() + 1);
    }
}
```

### Data Structure

#### Months Accrued Summary
```javascript
{
    totalMonths: 4,
    totalAmount: 540,
    firstMonth: "2025-05",
    lastMonth: "2025-08",
    averageAmount: 135,
    leaseStartMonth: "2025-05",
    leaseEndMonth: "2025-09",
    expectedMonthsFromLease: 5
}
```

#### Individual Month Details
```javascript
{
    month: "2025-05",
    amount: 0,
    transactionCount: 0,
    transactions: [],
    isLeaseStartMonth: true,
    isProrated: true
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Rental Accrual Service
```javascript
// In rentalAccrualService.js
await DebtorTransactionSyncService.updateDebtorFromAccrual(
    transactionEntry,
    student.student.toString(),
    rentAmount,
    monthKey,
    metadata
);
```

### 2. Enhanced Payment Allocation Service
```javascript
// In enhancedPaymentAllocationService.js
await DebtorTransactionSyncService.updateDebtorFromPayment(
    paymentTransaction,
    studentId,
    amount,
    monthKey,
    metadata
);
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created

1. **`test-months-tracking.js`**: Comprehensive test of months tracking functionality
2. **`test-lease-start-months-simple.js`**: Simple test focusing on lease start month inclusion
3. **`test-transaction-based-totals.js`**: Test of transaction-based totals calculation
