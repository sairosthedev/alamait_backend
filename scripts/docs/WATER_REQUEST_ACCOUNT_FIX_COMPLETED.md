# ✅ **Water Request Account Mapping Fix - COMPLETED**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified and Solved**

Your water request was incorrectly being mapped to the **Transportation Expense account (5003)** instead of the **Utilities - Water account (5001)**.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Issue:**
1. **Water requests were being categorized as "Maintenance"** instead of "Utilities"
2. **Account mapping was incorrect**: Maintenance → Transportation Expense (5003)
3. **Your chart of accounts has a perfect water account**: `5001: Utilities - Water`
4. **But the system was using the wrong mapping**

### **Why This Happened:**
- The categorization logic in monthly requests was not properly identifying water as "Utilities"
- The account mappings were set up incorrectly for utilities
- Water requests were falling back to the "Maintenance" category

---

## 📊 **Before vs After Results**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Water Request → Category: "Maintenance" → Account: 5003 (Transportation Expense)
❌ WRONG: Water expense was being recorded as Transportation Expense
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Water Request → Category: "Utilities" → Account: 5001 (Utilities - Water)
✅ CORRECT: Water expense is now recorded as Utilities - Water
```

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Water Request Flow:**
1. **Admin creates water request** → Category: "utilities"
2. **Request gets approved** → Creates expense with category "Utilities"
3. **Expense gets paid** → Creates transaction with account 5001 (Utilities - Water)
4. **Financial reports** → Water expenses appear under Utilities, not Transportation

### **Double-Entry Accounting:**
```
When water expense is paid:
Dr. 5001 (Utilities - Water) - $200.00
Cr. 1015 (Cash) - $200.00
```
