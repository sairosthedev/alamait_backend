## Database Migration Script

### Created: `src/scripts/fixResidenceReferences.js`
- **Purpose**: Fix existing records that don't have residence references
- **Functionality**: 
  - Finds all records without residence fields
  - Sets them to use the first available residence as default
  - Handles all entity types: applications, payments, students, events, maintenance, messages, leases
- **Usage**: Run with `node src/scripts/fixResidenceReferences.js`

## API Documentation Updated

### Swagger Documentation (`swagger.yaml`)
- **Updated**: Application submission schema to include residence as required field
- **Added**: Residence field description and validation

## Key Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: All entities now have proper residence associations
2. **Consistency**: Uniform handling of residence requirements across all entities
3. **Validation**: Proper validation at both model and API levels
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Migration script handles existing data
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when residence is missing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test all create endpoints** to ensure residence validation works
2. **Test migration script** on a copy of production data
3. **Verify existing functionality** still works after changes
4. **Test error scenarios** when residence ID is missing or invalid

## Deployment Notes

1. **Run migration script** before deploying to production
2. **Update frontend** to send residence IDs in all create requests
3. **Monitor logs** for any validation errors after deployment
4. **Test thoroughly** in staging environment first
