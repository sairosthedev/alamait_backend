# Payment Receipt Automation Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically generates a receipt PDF when an admin adds a payment, uploads it to S3, and sends it to the student's email.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (Payments.jsx)

#### Modified Functions:
- **`handleAddPayment`**: Now automatically calls `generateAndSendReceipt` after successful payment creation
- **`uploadToCloud`**: Updated to use backend S3 upload endpoint instead of Firebase

#### New Functions:
- **`generateAndSendReceipt`**: Generates PDF receipt and sends via email
- **`sendReceiptEmail`**: Sends formatted HTML email with receipt download link

### 2. Backend Changes

#### New S3 Configuration (src/config/s3.js):
```javascript
receipts: {
  bucket: bucketName,
  key: (req, file) => `receipts/${Date.now()}_${file.originalname}`,
  acl: 'public-read'
}
```

#### New API Endpoints:
- **`POST /api/admin/send-receipt-email`**: Sends receipt email to student
- **`POST /api/admin/upload-receipt`**: Uploads receipt PDF to S3

#### New Controller Functions (src/controllers/admin/paymentController.js):
- **`sendReceiptEmail`**: Handles email sending
- **`uploadReceiptHandler`**: Handles S3 upload for receipts

#### Updated Routes (src/routes/admin/adminRoutes.js):
- Added routes for receipt email and upload functionality

## How It Works

### 1. Payment Creation Flow:
1. Admin fills payment form and clicks "Add Payment"
2. Payment is created in database
3. System automatically generates PDF receipt
4. PDF is uploaded to S3 in `receipts/` folder
5. Email is sent to student with receipt download link
6. Success message shows "Payment added successfully and receipt sent to student!"

### 2. Receipt Generation:
- Uses jsPDF to create professional-looking receipt
- Includes company header, student details, payment breakdown, and total
- Generates unique filename with payment ID and timestamp

### 3. Email Content:
- Professional HTML email template
- Includes payment details and breakdown
- Download link to S3-hosted PDF
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### 4. S3 Storage:
- Receipts stored in `receipts/` folder
- Public-read access for easy download
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts
- 10MB file size limit for PDFs

## File Structure

```
src/
├── config/
│   └── s3.js (updated with receipts config)
├── controllers/admin/
│   └── paymentController.js (added email and upload functions)
├── routes/admin/
│   └── adminRoutes.js (added new endpoints)
└── utils/
    └── email.js (existing email utility)
```

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=alamait-uploads
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## Testing

### Test the Feature:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Payments
2. Click "Add Payment"
3. Fill in payment details
4. Click "Add Payment"
5. Check that:
   - Payment appears in the list
   - Success message shows receipt was sent
   - Student receives email with receipt download link
   - PDF can be downloaded from S3

### Error Handling:
- If email fails, payment is still created but user gets warning
- If S3 upload fails, error is logged and user is notified
- All errors are gracefully handled without breaking the payment creation

## Benefits

3. **Immediate Delivery**: Students get receipts instantly
4. **Secure Storage**: S3 provides reliable, scalable storage
