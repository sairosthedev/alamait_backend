## 🔄 **How Rental Accrual Works**

### **1. Monthly Rent Due (Accrual)**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable - [Property] (1101, 1102, 1103)
Cr. Rental Income - [Property] (4001, 4002, 4003)
```

**Example - St Kilda Rent Due:**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable - St Kilda (1101): $200.00
Cr. Rental Income - St Kilda (4001): $200.00
```

### **2. Tenant Payment Received**
```
Dr. Bank - Main Account (1110)
Cr. Accounts Receivable - [Property] (1101, 1102, 1103)
```

**Example - St Kilda Payment:**
```
Dr. Bank - Main Account (1110): $200.00
Cr. Accounts Receivable - St Kilda (1101): $200.00
