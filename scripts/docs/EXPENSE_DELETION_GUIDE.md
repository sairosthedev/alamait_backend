# üóëÔ∏è Expense Deletion with Transaction Cleanup Guide

## üìã **Overview**

This tool ensures that when you delete an expense, **ALL related transaction entries are also deleted** to maintain data integrity and prevent orphaned records that can cause balance sheet imbalances.

When you delete an expense without deleting its transaction entries:
- ‚ùå Transaction entries become orphaned

- ‚ùå Data integrity is compromised

### **The Solution**
This tool automatically:
- ‚úÖ Finds all related transaction entries
- ‚úÖ Deletes transaction entries first (maintaining referential integrity)
- ‚úÖ Deletes the expense record
- ‚úÖ Shows you exactly what will be deleted before doing it

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**

### **1. Comprehensive Transaction Detection**
Finds transactions by:
- Direct source ID reference
- Source model matching
- Description pattern matching

### **2. Account Impact Analysis**
Shows how deletion will affect account balances:
- Which accounts will be impacted
- How much each account balance will change
- Reverses the original transaction posting

### **3. Safety Features**
- **Dry Run Mode**: See what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **Confirmation Required**: Explicit confirmation for actual deletions
- **Detailed Logging**: Complete audit trail of what was deleted

### **4. Multiple Deletion Modes**
- Single expense deletion

node delete-expense-with-transactions.js 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 dry-run
```

### **2. Single Expense Deletion (Actual)**
```bash

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **1. Data Integrity**
- **Always use dry-run first** to see what will be deleted
- **Review the account impact** to ensure it's what you expect
- **Check for related records** that might be affected

### **2. Balance Sheet Impact**
Deleting an expense will:
- Remove the expense from your income statement
- Reverse the account balance changes from the original posting
- Potentially fix balance sheet imbalances

### **3. Audit Trail**
- All deletions are logged
- You can see exactly what was deleted
- Account balance impacts are calculated and shown

## üöÄ **Integration with Balance Sheet Fixes**

### **How This Helps Fix Your Balance Sheet**
1. **Identify Problem Expenses**: Use the tool to find expenses with incorrect transaction postings
2. **Clean Up Orphaned Records**: Remove expenses and their malformed transactions
3. **Restore Account Balances**: Deleting incorrect transactions can fix negative asset balances
4. **Verify Fixes**: Re-run balance sheet after deletions to see improvements

### **Example Scenario**
If you have an expense with incorrect double-entry:
```
INCORRECT:
DEBIT: Bank Account (1000) - $300
CREDIT: Bank Account (1000) - $300

RESULT: Bank Account shows negative balance
```

Using this tool to delete the expense will:
1. Remove the incorrect transaction entries
2. Restore the Bank Account balance
3. Fix the balance sheet imbalance

## üìä **Best Practices**

### **1. Always Start with Dry Run**
```bash
# First, see what would happen
node delete-expense-with-transactions.js <expenseId> dry-run

# Review the output carefully
# Then proceed with actual deletion if correct
node delete-expense-with-transactions.js <expenseId>
```

### **2. Batch Operations for Multiple Issues**
```bash
# If you have multiple problematic expenses
node delete-expense-with-transactions.js multiple <id1> <id2> <id3>
```

### **3. Regular Cleanup**
- Use the search functionality to find orphaned or problematic expenses
- Clean up regularly to prevent data integrity issues
- Monitor account balances after deletions

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Expense not found"**
- Verify the expense ID is correct
- Check if the expense was already deleted
- Ensure you're connected to the right database

#### **"No related transactions found"**
- The expense might not have generated transaction entries
- Check if the expense was properly posted to the accounting system
- Verify the expense status and posting date

#### **"Failed to delete transaction"**

### **Recovery Options**
