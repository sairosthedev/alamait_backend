# üÜï DEBTOR TRANSACTION SYNC IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview

This implementation automatically updates the debtors collection when transactions are created, specifically for:
- **Accruals**: Updates expected amounts and months expected
- **Payments**: Updates total paid amounts and months paid

## üéØ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Automatic Debtor Updates**
- **Real-time sync**: Debtors are updated immediately when transactions are created
- **Accrual tracking**: Monthly rent accruals automatically update debtor expected amounts
- **Payment tracking**: Payment allocations automatically update debtor paid amounts
- **Month-by-month tracking**: Detailed breakdown of expected vs paid amounts per month

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Data Structure**
- **Expected amounts**: Track what each student owes per month
- **Paid amounts**: Track what has been paid per month
- **Outstanding balances**: Calculate remaining amounts per month
- **Payment history**: Track when payments were made and for which months
- **Financial summaries**: Year-to-date and historical totals

### ‚úÖ **Business Logic Integration**
- **Smart FIFO allocation**: Works with existing payment allocation system
- **Status tracking**: Automatically updates debtor status (paid/overdue/active)
- **Balance calculations**: Real-time balance updates
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of sync failures

2. When payments are allocated ‚Üí debtors are automatically updated

### **Manual Backfill**
To sync existing transaction data:
```javascript
const DebtorTransactionSyncService = require('./src/services/debtorTransactionSyncService');
const result = await DebtorTransactionSyncService.syncAllTransactionsToDebtors();
```

### **Individual Updates**
For testing or manual updates:
```javascript
// Update from accrual
await DebtorTransactionSyncService.updateDebtorFromAccrual(
  transactionEntry,
  studentId,
  amount,
  monthKey,
  metadata
);

// Update from payment
await DebtorTransactionSyncService.updateDebtorFromPayment(
  transactionEntry,
  studentId,
  amount,
  monthKey,
  metadata
);
```
