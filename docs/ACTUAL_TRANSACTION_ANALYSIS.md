## üìã **What This Transaction Shows**

### **1. Payment Processing**
- This is a **payment transaction** (not an approval transaction)
- The expense was already approved and this is the actual payment
- Amount: R29.00 (much smaller than the MacDonald WiFi example)

### **2. Account Usage**
- **Accounts Payable (2000)**: General accounts payable account (not vendor-specific)
- **Ecocash Wallet (1003)**: Digital wallet used for payment
- This suggests the system can handle both vendor-specific and general payable accounts

### **3. Transaction Flow**
```
Dr. Accounts Payable (2000)     R29.00  (reduce liability)
Cr. Ecocash Wallet (1003)       R29.00  (reduce asset)
```
