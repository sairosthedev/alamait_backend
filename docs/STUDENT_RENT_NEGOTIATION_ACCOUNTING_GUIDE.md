## üìä **Proper Accounting Treatment**

### **1. Original Rent Accrual (When Student First Invoiced)**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable - Kudzai Pemhiwa    $150
    Cr. Student Accommodation Rent          $150
‚Üí Student owes $150, income recognized
```

### **2. Rent Negotiation (Your Transaction)**
```
Dr. Student Accommodation Rent              $30
    Cr. Accounts Receivable - Kudzai Pemhiwa $30
‚Üí Reduces income by $30, reduces A/R by $30
```

## üéØ **Balance Sheet Clarity Requirements**

For situations where students negotiate, the balance sheet should clearly reflect:

### **‚úÖ What Should Be Visible:**

1. **Original Accruals**
   - What was initially invoiced to the student
   - Shows the full rental obligation before negotiations

2. **Negotiated Adjustments**
   - Discounts given to students
   - Clear tracking of negotiation amounts

3. **Payments Received**
   - Actual cash received from students
   - Settlements of outstanding balances

4. **Net Outstanding Balances**
   - What students actually owe after negotiations
   - Current collectible amounts
