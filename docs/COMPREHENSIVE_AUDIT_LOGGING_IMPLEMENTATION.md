# Comprehensive Audit Logging Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive audit logging system implemented across the entire application to ensure all system operations are properly tracked and logged for compliance, security, and accountability purposes.

## Audit Logging Infrastructure

### Enhanced Audit Logger Utility (`src/utils/auditLogger.js`)

The audit logging system has been enhanced with specialized functions for different types of operations:

- **`createAuditLog`**: Core audit logging function with comprehensive data capture
- **`logVendorOperation`**: Specialized logging for vendor operations
- **`logTransactionOperation`**: Specialized logging for transaction operations
- **`logAccountOperation`**: Specialized logging for account operations
- **`logExpenseOperation`**: Specialized logging for expense operations
- **`logPaymentOperation`**: Specialized logging for payment operations
- **`logDebtorOperation`**: Specialized logging for debtor operations
- **`logSystemOperation`**: Specialized logging for automated system operations

### Audit Log Model (`src/models/AuditLog.js`)

The audit log model captures:
- **User**: Who performed the action
- **Action**: What action was performed (create, update, delete, etc.)
- **Collection**: Which collection/table was affected
- **RecordId**: The ID of the specific record
- **Before**: State before the action (for updates)
- **After**: State after the action
- **Details**: Additional context and metadata
- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred
- **IP Address**: Source IP (when available)
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information (when available)

- **Action**: `create`
- **Collection**: `Account`
- **Details**: Source, vendor ID, vendor name, account code, account type
- **Triggered**: When vendor-specific accounts payable account is created

### 3. Transaction Operations

#### Lease Start Transactions (`src/services/rentalAccrualService.js`)
- **Action**: `create`
- **Collection**: `TransactionEntry`
- **Details**: Source, type (lease_start), application ID, student ID, student name, amounts
- **Triggered**: When lease start accounting entries are created

#### Payment Allocation Transactions (`src/services/enhancedPaymentAllocationService.js`)
- **Action**: `create`
- **Collection**: `TransactionEntry`
- **Details**: Source, type (payment_allocation), payment ID, student ID, amount, payment type, month settled
- **Triggered**: When payment allocation transactions are created

### 4. Expense Operations

#### Admin Expense Creation (`src/controllers/admin/expenseController.js`)
- **Action**: `create`
- **Collection**: `Expense`
- **Details**: Source (Admin), description
- **Triggered**: When admin creates a new expense

#### Admin Expense AP Liability Creation (`src/controllers/admin/expenseController.js`)
- **Action**: `admin_expense_created_ap_liability`
- **Collection**: `Transaction`
- **Details**: Source, expense category, amounts, account codes
- **Triggered**: When AP liability transaction is created for admin expense

### 5. Student Operations

#### Student Creation (`src/controllers/admin/studentController.js`)
- **Action**: `create`
- **Collection**: `User`, `Application`, `Debtor`
- **Details**: Source, student information, application details
- **Triggered**: When new student is manually added

#### Student Bulk Upload (`src/controllers/admin/studentController.js`)
- **Action**: `bulk_upload`
- **Collection**: `User`, `Application`, `Debtor`
- **Details**: Source, upload type (CSV/Excel), number of students
- **Triggered**: When students are bulk uploaded

### 6. System Operations

All automated system operations are logged using the `logSystemOperation` function with the system user ID (`68b7909295210ad2fa2c5dcf`).

## Audit Log Access

### Finance Team Access (`src/controllers/finance/auditLogController.js`)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/finance/audit-log`
- **Access**: Finance team members
- **Features**: Filtering by collection, action, user, date range

### CEO Access (`src/controllers/ceo/auditController.js`)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/ceo/audit-log`
- **Access**: CEO role only
- **Features**: Full audit log access with filtering capabilities

### Admin Access (`src/controllers/admin/auditLogController.js`)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/audit-log`
- **Access**: Admin role only
- **Features**: Full audit log access with filtering capabilities

## Security and Compliance Features

### Data Integrity
- **Before/After States**: Captures complete state changes for updates
- **Immutable Logs**: Audit logs cannot be modified once created
- **Comprehensive Details**: Rich metadata for each operation

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for different user roles
- **Authentication Required**: All audit log endpoints require valid authentication
- **IP Tracking**: Source IP addresses are captured when available

### Performance Considerations
- **Asynchronous Logging**: Audit logging doesn't block main operations
- **Error Handling**: Failed audit logs don't prevent main operations
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for audit log retrieval

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Audit Log
```javascript
const { logVendorOperation } = require('../utils/auditLogger');

// Log vendor creation
await logVendorOperation('create', vendor, user._id, {
    source: 'Manual Creation',
    businessName: vendor.businessName,
    chartOfAccountsCode: vendor.chartOfAccountsCode
});
```

### Querying Audit Logs
```javascript
// Get audit logs for a specific collection
GET /api/finance/audit-log?collection=Vendor&action=create

// Get audit logs for a specific user
GET /api/finance/audit-log?user=68b7909295210ad2fa2c5dcf

// Get audit logs for a date range
GET /api/finance/audit-log?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
```
