# Financial Statement Date Handling Implementation

## Overview
The transaction system has been updated to use the correct dates from monthly requests for proper financial statement reporting. This ensures that expenses appear in the correct accounting periods based on accrual and cash basis accounting principles.

## Date Usage by Financial Statement

### 1. Income Statement (Accrual Basis)
**Uses: `dateRequested`** - When the expense is incurred

- **Purpose**: Shows expenses in the period when they were actually incurred, regardless of when payment was made
- **Transaction Type**: `expense_accrual` (maintenance approval)
- **Date Source**: `request.dateRequested`
- **Example**: If a maintenance request was made on January 15th but paid on February 10th, the expense appears in January's income statement

### 2. Balance Sheet (Cash Basis)
**Uses: `datePaid`** - When the expense is actually paid

- **Purpose**: Shows cash outflows and accounts payable in the period when payment was made
- **Transaction Type**: `vendor_payment` (cash payment)
- **Date Source**: `request.datePaid` (from linked monthly request)
- **Example**: If a maintenance request was made on January 15th but paid on February 10th, the cash outflow appears in February's balance sheet

### 3. Cash Flow Statement (Cash Basis)
**Uses: `datePaid`** - When the expense is actually paid

- **Purpose**: Shows actual cash movements in the period when they occurred
- **Transaction Type**: `vendor_payment` (cash payment)
- **Date Source**: `request.datePaid` (from linked monthly request)
- **Example**: If a maintenance request was made on January 15th but paid on February 10th, the cash outflow appears in February's cash flow statement

## Implementation Details

### Transaction Creation Flow

1. **Request Creation**:
   ```javascript
   // Monthly request created with dateRequested
   const monthlyRequest = new MonthlyRequest({
       dateRequested: dateRequested ? new Date(dateRequested) : new Date(),
       // ... other fields
   });
   ```

2. **Accrual Transaction** (Income Statement):
   ```javascript
   // Uses dateRequested for accrual basis
   const accrualDate = request.dateRequested ? new Date(request.dateRequested) : new Date();
   const transaction = new Transaction({
       date: accrualDate,
       type: 'approval',
       // ... other fields
   });
   ```

3. **Payment Transaction** (Balance Sheet/Cash Flow):
   ```javascript
   // Uses datePaid for cash basis
   let paymentDate = expense.paidDate || expense.date || new Date();
   if (expense.monthlyRequestId) {
       const monthlyRequest = await MonthlyRequest.findById(expense.monthlyRequestId);
       if (monthlyRequest && monthlyRequest.datePaid) {
           paymentDate = monthlyRequest.datePaid;
       }
   }
   const transaction = new Transaction({
       date: paymentDate,
       type: 'payment',
       // ... other fields
   });
   ```

### Database Schema Updates

#### MonthlyRequest Model
```javascript
dateRequested: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
},
datePaid: {
    type: Date
}
```

#### MonthlyApprovals Sub-Schema
```javascript
datePaid: { type: Date }
```

## Financial Statement Impact

### Before (Incorrect)
- All transactions used `new Date()` (current date)
- Expenses appeared in wrong accounting periods
- Monthly reports were inaccurate
- Cash flow didn't reflect actual payment timing

### After (Correct)
- **Income Statement**: Uses `dateRequested` (when expense incurred)
- **Balance Sheet**: Uses `datePaid` (when expense paid)
- **Cash Flow**: Uses `datePaid` (when cash actually moved)
- Monthly reports are accurate and reflect proper accounting periods

## Example Scenario

**Maintenance Request Timeline:**
- January 15, 2024: Request submitted (`dateRequested`)
- January 20, 2024: Request approved (accrual transaction created)
- February 10, 2024: Payment made (`datePaid`)

**Financial Statement Impact:**
- **January 2024 Income Statement**: Shows $500 maintenance expense
- **January 2024 Balance Sheet**: Shows $500 accounts payable
- **February 2024 Balance Sheet**: Shows $500 cash decrease, $500 accounts payable decrease
- **February 2024 Cash Flow**: Shows $500 cash outflow

## API Endpoints Updated

### Create Monthly Request
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/monthly-requests`
- **New Field**: `dateRequested` (optional, defaults to current date)

### Approve Monthly Request
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/monthly-requests/:id/approve`
- **New Field**: `datePaid` (optional, defaults to current date)

### Finance Approve Monthly Request
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/monthly-requests/:id/finance-approve`
- **New Field**: `datePaid` (optional, defaults to current date)

## Validation Rules

### Date Requested
- Cannot be in the future
- Defaults to current date if not provided
- Used for accrual basis transactions

### Date Paid
- Cannot be earlier than dateRequested
- Cannot be in the future
- Defaults to current date if not provided
- Used for cash basis transactions

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Create request with specific dateRequested**
2. **Approve request with specific datePaid**
3. **Verify transactions use correct dates**
4. **Check financial statements show expenses in correct periods**

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test date handling
node test-transaction-date-handling.js

# Verify monthly reports
GET /api/financial-reports/monthly-income-statement?period=2024-01
GET /api/financial-reports/monthly-balance-sheet?period=2024-02
GET /api/financial-reports/monthly-cash-flow?period=2024-02
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Financial Reporting**: Expenses appear in correct accounting periods
2. **Proper Cash Flow Tracking**: Cash movements reflect actual payment dates
3. **Compliance**: Follows accrual and cash basis accounting principles
4. **Better Decision Making**: Management can see accurate monthly performance
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between expense recognition and payment

## Migration Notes

- Existing transactions will continue to work
- New transactions will use the correct dates
- Historical data remains unchanged
- No data migration required
