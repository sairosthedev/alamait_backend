{
  "email": "ceo@alamait.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "firstName": "CEO",
  "lastName": "Name",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "role": "ceo"
}
```

### **CEO Approving a Request**
```json
PATCH /api/requests/:id/ceo-approval
{
  "approved": true,
  "notes": "Approved after review of financial impact"
}
```

### **CEO Rejecting a Request**
```json
PATCH /api/requests/:id/ceo-approval
{
  "approved": false,
  "notes": "Rejected due to budget constraints"
}
```

## Security Features

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- CEO role is properly validated on all endpoints
- Write operations are restricted except for request approvals
- Audit logging for all CEO actions

### **Request Approval Validation**
- CEO can only approve requests that have admin and finance approval
- Proper validation prevents unauthorized approvals
- Complete audit trail of all approvals

### **Data Protection**
- CEO cannot modify sensitive financial data
- CEO cannot create or delete system users
- CEO cannot modify system configurations

## Testing

### **Test CEO Access:**
1. Create a CEO user
2. Login with CEO credentials
3. Test viewing all system data
4. Test request approval workflow
5. Verify write operations are blocked

### **Test Request Approval:**
1. Create a request as admin
2. Approve with admin role
3. Approve with finance role
4. Approve with CEO role
5. Verify request status changes

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should:
- Show CEO-specific dashboard with request approvals
- Hide create/edit/delete buttons for CEO users
- Show approval workflow status
- Display CEO approval interface for pending requests

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **403 Forbidden on write operations** - This is expected for CEO role
2. **Cannot approve request** - Check if admin and finance have approved first
3. **Cannot view data** - Check if CEO role is properly assigned

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Check user role in database
2. Verify JWT token contains correct role
3. Check server logs for role validation
4. Ensure request approval workflow is followed

## Future Enhancements

### **Potential Additions:**
- CEO dashboard with key metrics
- CEO notification system for pending approvals
- CEO report generation
- CEO-specific audit logs
- CEO approval delegation

### **Monitoring:**
- Track CEO approval times
- Monitor request approval patterns
- Generate CEO activity reports
- Alert on unusual approval patterns

## Conclusion

The CEO role implementation provides:
- **Comprehensive view access** to all system data
- **Controlled approval authority** for requests only
- **Secure role-based access** with proper validation
- **Complete audit trail** for all CEO actions
- **Scalable architecture** for future enhancements

This implementation ensures the CEO has the visibility needed to make informed decisions while maintaining proper security controls and data integrity.
