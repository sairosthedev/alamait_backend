# Expense Creation and Double Entry Accounting System Summary

## Overview

The system now has a comprehensive expense creation and double entry accounting system that handles both **expense accruals** (when requests are approved) and **expense payments** (when expenses are marked as paid).

## Current Flow

### 1. When `financeStatus === 'approved'` ✅

**What happens:**
- Creates expense records with double entry transactions
- Uses the `DoubleEntryAccountingService.recordMaintenanceApproval()` method
- Creates **accrual-based** transactions (expense recognized, liability recorded)

**Process:**
1. **Request Approval**: Finance user approves the request
2. **Expense Creation**: System creates expense record(s)
3. **Double Entry Transaction**: Creates transaction with proper debit/credit entries
4. **Account Mapping**: Intelligently maps to appropriate expense accounts

**Double Entry Structure:**
```
DEBIT:  [Appropriate Expense Account] - Amount
CREDIT: [Accounts Payable - Vendor]   - Amount
```

### 2. When Marking as Paid ✅

**What happens:**
- Creates double entry transactions for expenses
- Uses the `FinancialService.markExpenseAsPaid()` method
- Creates **cash basis** transactions (liability reduced, cash/bank reduced)

**Process:**
1. **Payment Processing**: Finance user marks expense as paid
2. **Double Entry Transaction**: Creates payment transaction
3. **Account Updates**: Updates payment status and creates payment entries

**Double Entry Structure:**
```
DEBIT:  [Accounts Payable - Vendor] - Amount
CREDIT: [Cash/Bank Account]         - Amount
```

## Enhanced Account Resolution

### Intelligent Category Mapping

The system now uses **multiple strategies** to resolve expense accounts when no category is specified:

#### Strategy 1: Item Category (if available)
```javascript
const categoryMap = {
    'maintenance': '5007',      // Property Maintenance
    'plumbing': '5007',         // Property Maintenance
    'electrical': '5007',       // Property Maintenance
    'cleaning': '5009',         // Cleaning Services
    'security': '5014',         // Security Services
    'landscaping': '5012',      // Garden & Landscaping
    'supplies': '5011',         // Maintenance Supplies
    'services': '5062'          // Professional Fees
};
```

#### Strategy 2: Request Type
```javascript
const typeMap = {
    'maintenance': '5007',         // Property Maintenance
    'student_maintenance': '5007', // Property Maintenance
    'financial': '5062',           // Professional Fees
    'operational': '5007',         // Property Maintenance
    'administrative': '5062'       // Professional Fees
};
```

#### Strategy 3: Intelligent Name Matching
The system analyzes item descriptions to map to appropriate accounts:

- **Plumbing/Electrical/HVAC**: `5007` (Property Maintenance)
- **Cleaning**: `5009` (Cleaning Services)
- **Security**: `5014` (Security Services)
- **Landscaping**: `5012` (Garden & Landscaping)
- **Supplies**: `5011` (Maintenance Supplies)
- **Administrative**: `5062` (Professional Fees)

#### Strategy 4: Request Title Context
Uses the overall request title for additional context

#### Strategy 5: Fallback
Defaults to `5007` (Property Maintenance)

## Account Structure

### Expense Accounts Used

- **5009**: Cleaning Services

### Liability Accounts
