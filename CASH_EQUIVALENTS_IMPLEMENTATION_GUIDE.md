3. **Short-term Deposits** - Bank deposits maturing within 3 months
4. **Mobile Wallets** - EcoCash, InnBucks, OneMoney, etc.
5. **Petty Cash** - Small cash funds for minor expenses

};

const investingActivities = {
    purchase_of_property_improvements: 0, // Property improvements (paint, plumbing)

};
```

### **Cash and Cash Equivalents Breakdown**

```javascript
const cashAndCashEquivalentsBreakdown = {
    cash_on_hand: 0,                  // Physical cash
    cash_at_bank: 0,                  // Bank account balances
    short_term_deposits: 0,           // Deposits maturing ‚â§ 3 months

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Key Methods Added:**

1. **`generateCashBasisCashFlowStatement(period, residence)`**
   - Enhanced to include cash and cash equivalents
   - Proper categorization of cash flows
   - IFRS 7 compliant structure

2. **`getOpeningCashAndCashEquivalents(asOfDate, residence)`**
   - Calculates opening balance of cash and cash equivalents
   - Used for cash flow reconciliation

3. **`getCashAndCashEquivalentsBreakdown(asOfDate, residence)`**
   - Provides detailed breakdown of cash components
   - Categorizes by account type and name

4. **`validateCashFlowReconciliation(period, residence)`**
   - Validates that cash flow statement reconciles with actual balances
   - Ensures accuracy and completeness

### **Account Code Mapping:**

```javascript
// Cash and Cash Equivalents Accounts (1000-1019)
'1000' - Bank - Main Account
'1005' - Bank - Rent Deposits Account
'1010' - General Petty Cash
'1011' - Admin Petty Cash
'1012' - Finance Petty Cash
'1013' - Property Manager Petty Cash
'1014' - Maintenance Petty Cash
'1015' - Cash
```
