### ✅ **Payment Status Updates**
When a payment status is updated to `Paid`, `confirmed`, or `completed`:
- **Receipt is automatically generated** (if not already exists)
- **PDF is created and uploaded to S3**
- **Email is sent to student**
- **Receipt is stored in database**

### ✅ **Application Payments**
When application payment status is marked as paid:
- **Receipt is automatically generated**
- **PDF is created and uploaded to S3**

- **Receipt is stored in database**

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Payment Creation (`createPayment`)

**Location**: `src/controllers/admin/paymentController.js`

**Trigger**: When payment is created with successful status
```javascript
// Auto-generate receipt for all successful payments
if (status === 'confirmed' || status === 'completed' || status === 'paid') {
    // Generate receipt automatically
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Creates detailed receipt items based on payment breakdown
- ✅ Handles rent, admin fee, and deposit separately
- ✅ Includes student and payment details
- ✅ Generates professional PDF
- ✅ Sends email to student
- ✅ Logs success/failure for debugging

### Payment Status Updates (`updatePaymentStatus`)

**Location**: `src/controllers/admin/paymentController.js` and `src/controllers/finance/paymentController.js`

**Trigger**: When payment status is updated to successful
```javascript
// Auto-generate receipt when payment status is updated to successful
if (status === 'Paid' || status === 'confirmed' || status === 'completed') {
    // Check if receipt already exists
    // Generate receipt if not exists
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Checks for existing receipts to avoid duplicates
- ✅ Creates detailed receipt items
- ✅ Handles both admin and finance controllers
- ✅ Includes comprehensive logging

### Application Payments (`updatePaymentStatus`)

**Location**: `src/controllers/admin/applicationController.js`

**Trigger**: When application payment is marked as paid
```javascript
// Auto-generate receipt for application payment
// Creates receipt for room allocation or upgrade payments
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Handles room allocation payments
- ✅ Handles room upgrade payments
- ✅ Creates appropriate receipt descriptions
- ✅ Links to application and room details

## 📊 Receipt Details Generated

### Receipt Items
The system automatically creates detailed receipt items based on payment breakdown:

```javascript
// For detailed payments
receiptItems = parsedPayments.map(paymentItem => ({
    description: `${paymentItem.type.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + paymentItem.type.slice(1)} Payment - ${paymentMonth}`,
    quantity: 1,
    unitPrice: paymentItem.amount,
    totalPrice: paymentItem.amount
}));

// For single payments
receiptItems = [{
    description: `Accommodation Payment - ${paymentMonth}`,
    quantity: 1,
    unitPrice: totalAmount,
    totalPrice: totalAmount
}];
```

### Receipt Information
Each receipt includes:
- ✅ **Receipt Number**: Auto-generated (e.g., RCP2024001)
- ✅ **Student Details**: Name, email, phone
- ✅ **Payment Details**: Amount, method, reference
- ✅ **Residence Details**: Name, address
- ✅ **Room Details**: Room number (if applicable)
- ✅ **Items Breakdown**: Detailed payment items
- ✅ **Notes**: Payment description

## 📧 Email Integration

### Automatic Email Sending
When a receipt is generated, an email is automatically sent to the student:

```javascript
// Email is sent automatically via receiptController
await sendReceiptEmail(receipt, student, pdfUrl);
```

### Email Content
The email includes:
- ✅ **Subject**: "Payment Receipt - [Receipt Number]"
- ✅ **Student Name**: Personalized greeting
- ✅ **Receipt Number**: For reference
- ✅ **Amount**: Total payment amount

## 🔍 Logging and Monitoring

### Success Logging
```javascript
console.log(`✅ Receipt automatically generated for payment ${payment.paymentId}`);
console.log(`   Student: ${studentExists.firstName} ${studentExists.lastName}`);
console.log(`   Amount: $${totalAmount}`);
console.log(`   Receipt Number: ${data?.data?.receipt?.receiptNumber || 'N/A'}`);
```

### Error Logging
```javascript
console.error('❌ Error auto-generating receipt:', receiptError);
console.error('   Payment ID:', payment.paymentId);
console.error('   Student:', studentExists.firstName, studentExists.lastName);
```

### Duplicate Prevention
```javascript
console.log(`ℹ️  Receipt already exists for payment ${payment.paymentId}`);
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling
