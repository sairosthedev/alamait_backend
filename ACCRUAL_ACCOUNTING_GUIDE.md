# 🎯 **Accrual vs. Cash Basis Accounting System**

## 📊 **What You Now Have**

Your property management system implements **proper accrual accounting** alongside cash basis tracking.

---

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **1. Monthly Accruals (Accrual Basis)**
- Created on 1st of each month
- Records rent/admin fees as **earned income**
- Shows revenue when due, not when received

### **2. Cash Payments (Cash Basis)**
- Recorded when students actually pay
- Shows your real cash position

---

## 📈 **Monthly Reports**

### **🏆 Income Statement (Accrual)**
Shows revenue **earned** in the month.

**Example:**
```
Revenue: $1,185 (5 students × monthly amounts)
Net Income: $1,185
```

### **⚖️ Balance Sheet (Accrual)**
Shows financial position as of month-end.

**Example:**
```
Assets: $1,185 (Bank: $300 + Receivables: $885)
Liabilities: $500 (Tenant Deposits)
Equity: $685
```

### **💸 Cash Flow (Cash Basis)**
Shows actual cash movements.

**Example:**
```
Cash Collections: $300
Net Operating Cash: $300
```
