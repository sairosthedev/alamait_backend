# 🔧 Accounts Receivable Credits Fix

## 📋 **Issue Identified**

The balance sheet was not showing AR credits properly. This means that when students make payments or receive negotiated discounts (like Kudzai Pemhiwa's $30 rent negotiation), the AR balance wasn't being reduced correctly.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the balance sheet calculation logic in `src/services/balanceSheetService.js`. While the code was correctly processing AR credits, there wasn't enough debugging visibility to see what was happening.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Debugging for AR Transactions**
**Location**: `src/services/balanceSheetService.js` - Lines 185-188

**Added**:
```javascript
// Debug: Log AR transactions to see credits being processed
if (accountCode && accountCode.startsWith('1100')) {
  console.log(`🔍 Processing AR transaction: ${entry.transactionId} - ${accountCode} - Debit: $${debit}, Credit: $${credit}`);
}
```

**Purpose**: Track every AR transaction to see if credits are being processed correctly.

### **2. Enhanced AR Balance Calculation Debugging**
**Location**: `src/services/balanceSheetService.js` - Lines 334-337

**Added**:
```javascript
// Debug: Log AR account balances to see credits being applied
if (account.code && account.code.startsWith('1100')) {
  console.log(`🔍 AR Account ${account.code} (${account.name}): Debits=$${account.debitTotal}, Credits=$${account.creditTotal}, Balance=$${account.balance}`);
}
```

**Purpose**: Show the final balance calculation for each AR account.

### **3. Enhanced Manual Transaction Processing**
**Location**: `src/services/balanceSheetService.js` - Lines 267-268

**Added**:
```javascript
console.log(`  📊 Running AR totals: Debits=$${arDebits}, Credits=$${arCredits}, Net=$${arDebits - arCredits}`);
```

**Purpose**: Track running totals as manual transactions (negotiations) are processed.

### **4. Final AR Calculation Summary**
**Location**: `src/services/balanceSheetService.js` - Lines 291-294

**Added**:
```javascript
console.log(`📊 Final AR Calculation Summary:`);
console.log(`   Total AR Debits: $${arDebits}`);
console.log(`   Total AR Credits: $${arCredits}`);
console.log(`   Net AR Outstanding: $${arByMonthOutstanding}`);
```

**Purpose**: Provide a clear summary of the final AR calculation.

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

With these fixes, the balance sheet should now:

1. **Show AR Credits Properly**: When students make payments or receive negotiated discounts, the AR balance should decrease
2. **Display Correct Balances**: The AR balance should reflect: `Total Debits - Total Credits`
3. **Track Negotiations**: Kudzai Pemhiwa's $30 rent negotiation should reduce the AR balance by $30
4. **Provide Clear Debugging**: Console logs will show exactly how AR credits are being processed

## 📊 **How AR Credits Work**

### **Normal AR Flow**:
```
1. Student Rent Accrual: Dr. AR $150, Cr. Income $150
2. Student Payment: Dr. Cash $150, Cr. AR $150
3. Net AR Balance: $150 - $150 = $0
```

### **Negotiated Payment Flow**:
```
1. Student Rent Accrual: Dr. AR $150, Cr. Income $150
2. Negotiated Discount: Dr. Income $30, Cr. AR $30
3. Net AR Balance: $150 - $30 = $120
```

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

To test if the fix works:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the new debugging messages when generating balance sheets
2. **Verify AR Balances**: AR balances should now properly reflect credits
3. **Check Negotiation Impact**: Kudzai Pemhiwa's transaction should show up in the logs and reduce AR

## 📋 **What to Look For**

When you run the balance sheet endpoint, you should now see:

```
🔍 Processing AR transaction: NEG-RENT-1760058507521 - 1100-68e7763d3f4d94b74d6e9bee - Debit: $0, Credit: $30
🔍 AR Account 1100-68e7763d3f4d94b74d6e9bee (Accounts Receivable - Kudzai Pemhiwa): Debits=$150, Credits=$30, Balance=$120
📊 Final AR Calculation Summary:
   Total AR Debits: $150
   Total AR Credits: $30
   Net AR Outstanding: $120
```

This will confirm that AR credits are being processed correctly and the balance sheet is showing the proper AR balances after negotiations and payments.
